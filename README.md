# Go Microservice Project

This project is a web server developed in Go, following the microservice pattern. It includes a basic structure to start development, with a `main.go` file that runs an HTTP server and recommended dependencies for microservices.

## Initial Structure

- `main.go`: Entry point for the web server.
- `go.mod`: Go module for dependency management.
- `/internal`: Suggested folder for microservice internal logic.
- `/pkg`: Suggested folder for reusable packages.

## Getting Started

1. Install Go ([official instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install))
2. Run `go run main.go` to start the server.

## Customization

You can add routes, controllers, and business logic in the `/internal` folder.
